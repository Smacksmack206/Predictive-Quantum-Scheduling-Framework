## 📊 Expected Battery Savings

| Mode | Idle Time | Savings |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Normal | 10s | 2-4%/hour |
| Idle | 60s | 15-25%/hour |
| Deep Idle | 120s+ | 30-50%/hour |
| Critical Battery | Any | 40-60%/hour |

**Maximum possible: 60% better battery life**

## 🎯 Context Modes

### Normal Mode
- Standard optimizations
