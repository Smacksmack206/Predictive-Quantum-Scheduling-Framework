# Dynamic Learning Battery Protection System

## 🎯 Overview

The system now uses **quantum-hybrid ML** to dynamically learn which apps need protection based on **actual behavior**, not hardcoded lists. It continuously adapts to YOUR specific usage patterns.

## ✅ What Changed

### Before (Hardcoded)
```python
# Static list - same for everyone
priority_apps = [
    'Kiro', 'Electron', 'Code', 
    'Slack', 'Discord', 'Chrome'
]
```

### After (Dynamic Learning)
```python
# Learned from YOUR behavior
priority_apps = []  # Populated by ML
_load_priority_apps_from_db()  # Load learned priorities
_discover_high_impact_apps()   # Discover new ones
_update_priority_apps()        # Continuously adapt
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Database Learning** (Persistent)
Loads previously learned priority apps from database:

```sql
SELECT process_name, 
       AVG(avg_energy_saved) as impact,
       SUM(times_applied) as frequency,
       AVG(success_rate) as success
FROM process_optimizations
WHERE frequency > 3 AND success > 0.5
ORDER BY impact DESC
```

**Result**: Apps that have been successfully optimized before are prioritized

### 2. **Dynamic Discovery** (Real-time)
Continuously scans all running processes to find high-impact apps:

```python
for each process:
    impact_score = (cpu * 2.0) + (memory * 0.5)
    if impact_score > 5.0:
        add_to_high_impact_list()
```

**Result**: New battery-draining apps are discovered automatically

### 3. **Behavioral Pattern Learning**
Learns how each app behaves over time:

- **Idle**: App running but not doing much → Aggressive throttling
- **Burst**: Occasional high usage → Moderate throttling  
- **Steady**: Consistent usage → Balanced optimization
- **Chaotic**: Erratic behavior → Aggressive optimization
- **Periodic**: Regular patterns → Predictive optimization

### 4. **Priority Scoring**
Calculates dynamic priority score for each app:

```python
priority_score = impact * frequency * success_rate
```

- **Impact**: How much battery it drains
- **Frequency**: How often it needs optimization
- **Success Rate**: How well optimization works

### 5. **Proactive Optimization**
Predicts and prevents battery drain before it happens:

```python
if pattern_confidence > 0.7:
    if pattern in ['chaotic', 'burst'] and battery < 50%:
        proactively_throttle()  # Prevent drain before it occurs
```

## 🔬 Advanced Features

### 1. **Quantum-ML Prediction**
Uses quantum circuits to predict power consumption:
```python
# Quantum superposition analyzes multiple scenarios
predicted_power = quantum_ml.predict_power_consumption(features)

if predicted_power > 15.0:
    apply_predictive_throttle()
```

### 2. **Correlation Detection**
Finds apps that drain battery together:
```python
# Example: Kiro + Chrome often run together
# Optimize both coordinately for better results
if apps_correlated(['Kiro', 'Chrome']):
    apply_coordinated_optimization()
```

### 3. **Adaptive Thresholds**
Automatically adjusts optimization aggressiveness:
```python
if avg_power > 15.0:
    thresholds['cpu_aggressive'] *= 0.95  # More aggressive
elif avg_power < 8.0:
    thresholds['cpu_aggressive'] *= 1.02  # More lenient
```

# System automatically detects all Kiro processes
kiro_processes = [
    'Kiro',
    'Kiro Helper (Renderer)',
    'Kiro Helper (GPU)',
    'Kiro Helper (Plugin)'
]

# Learns their patterns
patterns = {
    'Kiro Helper (Renderer)': 'burst',    # UI updates
    'Kiro Helper (GPU)':      'idle',     # Often unnecessary
    'Kiro Helper (Plugin)':   'steady'    # Extensions

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Test dynamic learning
python test_dynamic_simple.py

# Start auto-protection with dynamic learning
python auto_battery_protection.py

# Check learned priorities
sqlite3 ~/.pqs_quantum_ml.db \
  "SELECT process_name, AVG(avg_energy_saved), SUM(times_applied) 
   FROM process_optimizations 
   GROUP BY process_name 
   ORDER BY AVG(avg_energy_saved) DESC"
```

**Expected Result**: System automatically learns that Kiro is a high-priority app and applies optimal protection strategies without any manual configuration.
