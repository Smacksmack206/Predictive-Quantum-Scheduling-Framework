## 🟡 Minor Issues (Easy Fixes)

### 1. Code Quality (8/10)
**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Missing type hints in some functions
- ⚠️ Inconsistent docstring format
- ⚠️ Some error handling could be more specific
- ⚠️ A few long functions (>100 lines)

**Impact:** Low - code works perfectly, just needs polish

**Fix (1-2 days):**
```python
# Add type hints
def optimize_system(self, metrics: SystemMetrics) -> OptimizationResult:
    """
    Optimize system based on current metrics.
    
    Args:
        metrics: Current system state with CPU, memory, battery info
        
    Returns:
        OptimizationResult with energy savings and quantum advantage
        
    Raises:
        OptimizationError: If quantum engine fails
    """
    pass
```

### 2. Testing (6/10)
**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Tests archived (in archive_20251025_171143/tests/)
- ⚠️ No CI/CD pipeline
- ⚠️ Manual testing only
- ⚠️ No automated regression tests

**Impact:** Medium - could catch bugs earlier

**Fix (3-5 days):**
```bash
# Restore and organize tests
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,performance}
# Add pytest configuration
# Set up GitHub Actions CI
```

### 3. Documentation (8/10)
**Issues:**
- ⚠️ No API reference
- ⚠️ No architecture diagrams
- ⚠️ No contribution guide
- ⚠️ Installation could be simpler

**Impact:** Low - current docs are good, just incomplete

**Fix (2-3 days):**
- Generate API docs with Sphinx
- Create architecture diagrams
- Write CONTRIBUTING.md
- Simplify installation

### 4. Configuration (7/10)
**Issues:**
- ⚠️ No config file (hardcoded values)
- ⚠️ No user preferences
- ⚠️ No easy way to adjust thresholds
- ⚠️ Settings scattered across files

**Impact:** Low - defaults are good, but users can't customize

**Fix (2-3 days):**
```python
# config.yaml
quantum:
  engine: qiskit  # or cirq
  max_qubits: 48
  
idle_management:
  suspend_delay: 30  # seconds
  sleep_delay: 120
  
battery:
  critical_threshold: 20  # percent
  aggressive_mode: true
```
