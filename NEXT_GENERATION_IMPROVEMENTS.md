### 5.2 Quantum Thermal Management
**Problem:** Thermal throttling reduces performance and wastes energy

**Solution:** Predict and prevent thermal issues using quantum ML

        - Performance drops 50%
        
        Quantum predictive approach:
        - Predict temperature 30 seconds ahead
        - Reduce load preemptively
