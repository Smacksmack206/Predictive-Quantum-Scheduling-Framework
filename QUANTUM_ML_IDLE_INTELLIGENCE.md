## 🎯 How It Works

### Phase 1: Pattern Recognition
```
You use Mac → System learns:
- Time of day patterns
- Day of week patterns  
- Typical idle durations
- Activity transitions
```

### Phase 2: Quantum Prediction
```
System goes idle → Quantum-ML predicts:
1. Quantum algorithm explores all possible return times
2. ML model refines prediction with context
3. Confidence score calculated
4. Optimal timing determined
```

### Phase 3: Intelligent Action
```
Based on prediction:
- High confidence + long absence = Aggressive sleep
- Medium confidence = Suspend apps, then sleep
- Low confidence = Conservative monitoring
```

### Phase 4: Learning
```
You return → System learns:
- Actual vs predicted return time
- Updates ML model
- Improves accuracy
- Adjusts future predictions
```

## 🔬 Quantum Algorithms Used

### 1. **Quantum Weighted Average**
```python
# Uses quantum superposition to explore all weighted combinations
# Quantum interference amplifies most likely prediction
prediction = Σ(return_time_i × weight_i × quantum_factor)
```

### 2. **Quantum Optimization (QAOA-inspired)**
```python
# Optimizes sleep timing by minimizing:
Cost = battery_drain + user_inconvenience
# Subject to: predicted_return, battery_level, confidence
```

### 3. **Quantum Enhancement**
```python
# Adds quantum fluctuations for exploration
quantum_factor = 1.0 + (0.2 × quantum_noise)
# Prevents local minima, explores solution space
```

```
Suspend: 10-60 seconds (based on prediction)
Sleep: 30-300 seconds (based on confidence + battery)

Examples:
- 95% confident, 30min away, 20% battery → 10s suspend, 30s sleep
- 70% confident, 5min away, 80% battery → 30s suspend, 120s sleep
- 50% confident, unknown, 100% battery → 60s suspend, 180s sleep
```

## 🔋 Battery Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Confidence-Based
```
High confidence (>80%) → Aggressive
Medium confidence (60-80%) → Balanced
Low confidence (<60%) → Conservative
```

### Strategy 2: Battery-Aware
```
Critical (<20%) → Maximum aggression
Low (<40%) → High aggression
Medium (40-70%) → Balanced
High (>70%) → User convenience priority
```

### Strategy 3: Pattern-Based
```
Known pattern → Trust prediction
New situation → Conservative approach
Conflicting data → Quantum exploration
```
